### The "Tell Me About Yourself" Pitch

This is your two-minute verbal resume. It should be confident, concise, and memorable. Don't just list your jobs; tell a story.

**Here is a script based on your resume:**

> "I'm a Senior Software Engineer with over six years of experience specializing in designing and building scalable, cloud-native applications.
>
> My expertise is in full-stack development, primarily using **Python** for the backend and **React with TypeScript** for the frontend. I'm also deeply experienced in building out the infrastructure that supports these applications, using tools like **AWS and Terraform** to create resilient and repeatable systems.
>
> What makes my background a bit unique is that I've applied these skills in very different environments. At Inter-Con, I focus on commercial applications, leading frontend performance optimizations and mentoring developers. Before that, I worked in a scientific domain, building real-time seismic data systems for CIRES and even leading the development of an open-source Python library for drug discovery at a children's hospital.
>
> This diverse experience has taught me how to adapt and apply core software engineering principles to solve complex problems, whether it's a security vulnerability or a scientific challenge. I'm passionate about not just writing code, but building robust systems and helping other developers on my team grow. I'm looking for a role where I can continue to take on that kind of technical ownership and have a real impact."

### Key Themes to Emphasize Throughout the Interview

Your resume supports several key themes. Weave these into your answers to different questions.

**1. The End-to-End Owner:**
*   **What it means:** You don't just work on one piece of the puzzle. You can design the cloud architecture, build the API, create the frontend, and set up the CI/CD pipeline.
*   **When to use it:** When asked about your experience, challenging projects, or technical leadership.
*   **Example phrase:** *"In my current role, I can take a feature from the initial architectural design in AWS all the way to implementing the final UI touches in React. For example..."*

**2. The Proactive Problem-Solver:**
*   **What it means:** You don't wait to be told what to do. You identify issues (performance, security, process) and take the initiative to fix them.
*   **When to use it:** When asked about a time you showed leadership, a challenging project, or your biggest accomplishment.
*   **Example phrase:** *"I noticed our frontend performance was degrading, so I took the initiative to lead a deep-dive. We were able to improve our response times by optimizing..."*

**3. The Mentor and Team Builder:**
*   **What it means:** You make the entire team better, not just yourself.
*   **When to use it:** When asked about teamwork, leadership, or mentoring.
*   **Example phrase:** *"I'm really passionate about mentoring. At my current company, I regularly conduct code reviews and pair-program with junior developers to help them get up to speed with our standards for performance and quality."*

**4. The Bridge Between Worlds (Scientific & Commercial):**
*   **What it means:** You have the intellectual curiosity and adaptability to learn a complex domain (like cheminformatics or seismology) and apply high-quality software engineering to it.
*   **When to use it:** When asked about your ability to learn new things, a time you faced a steep learning curve, or what makes you unique.
*   **Example phrase:** *"My work in scientific computing, like developing a library for drug discovery, taught me the importance of rigor and correctness. I bring that same mindset to building commercial applications."*

### How to Answer Specific, Common Questions

**"Why are you interested in this role?"**
Connect your key themes to *their* job description.
> "I was really drawn to this role because it seems to value end-to-end ownership. I saw you're using [AWS, Python, React, etc.], which aligns perfectly with my experience in building full-stack, cloud-native systems. I was also particularly excited about [mention a specific challenge or product from the company], as it seems like a complex problem where I could apply my experience in both performance optimization and resilient architecture."

**"Tell me about a challenging project you've worked on."**
Use a story that highlights one of your key themes. The story about securing the infrastructure by refactoring the Terraform code would be perfect here. It shows initiative, security awareness, and learning under pressure. Use the **STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)** to structure it.

**"What are your biggest strengths?"**
List your key themes as your strengths.
> "I'd say my biggest strength is my **versatility**. I'm very comfortable across the full stack, from designing infrastructure in Terraform to building user interfaces in React. This allows me to take on complex features from end to end. A second strength would be my **proactive approach to problem-solving**. I enjoy not just completing tasks, but actively looking for ways to improve our systems, whether that's in performance, security, or our development process."
