‚úÖ How to Get Better (Tactical Plan)

1. Deliberate Practice: Pattern-Based

Focus on problem types, not just problems.
	‚Ä¢	Prefix sum + hash map
	‚Ä¢	Problems like: Subarray sum equals K, Count nice subarrays, Range sum queries
	‚Ä¢	Frequency maps
	‚Ä¢	Problems like: Two sum, K-diff pairs, Majority elements
	‚Ä¢	Sliding window + sets/maps
	‚Ä¢	Problems like: Longest substring without repeating characters, Minimum window substring
	‚Ä¢	State tracking
	‚Ä¢	Problems like: Number of subarrays divisible by K, Balance of 0s and 1s, etc.

üõ† Practice Strategy:
	‚Ä¢	Solve 3‚Äì5 problems per category.
	‚Ä¢	After each, explicitly write down:
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúWhat was the key insight?‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúWhat data structure helped and what did it store?‚Äù

2. Redesign the Brute Force First

Don‚Äôt skip it! Writing or simulating a brute-force solution:
	‚Ä¢	Helps you identify repeated computation
	‚Ä¢	Shows which parts vary and which parts don‚Äôt
	‚Ä¢	Suggests what can be stored to avoid recomputation

Once you spot redundancy, ask:

‚ÄúCan I precompute this?‚Äù
‚ÄúCan I cache it?‚Äù
‚ÄúCan I represent this evolving state more compactly?‚Äù

‚∏ª

3. Work Backward from Examples

Take a small input (like [1,2,3]) and manually trace:
	‚Ä¢	The brute force pairs
	‚Ä¢	The cumulative data (like prefix sum)
	‚Ä¢	When/where the condition is met

Ask:

‚ÄúWhat must be true before I reach this element for the condition to hold?‚Äù

This is often how you discover what you should track in a hash map.

4. Study Editorials & Re-implement

After solving a problem (or seeing the solution), don‚Äôt just move on. Try this:
	‚Ä¢	Close the solution.
	‚Ä¢	Re-implement from scratch 1‚Äì2 days later.
	‚Ä¢	Force yourself to rederive the key insight.
	‚Ä¢	If you can‚Äôt, re-read the solution and explain it out loud or write a comment block about it.

‚∏ª

5. Keep a ‚ÄúTricks Notebook‚Äù

Every time you solve an optimized solution using a hash table, sliding window, or prefix sum:
	‚Ä¢	Write down the name of the problem
	‚Ä¢	What structure you used
	‚Ä¢	What you stored and why
	‚Ä¢	The key insight that made it click

This builds your intuition library.
