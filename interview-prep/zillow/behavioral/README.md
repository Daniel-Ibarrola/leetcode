# Behavioral Questions

## Most Challenging Project
Take 5-10 minutes to describe the most challenging project or
feature you have led. What was the problem you were trying to solve and how did
you solve it?

### Consumers are our North Star
- Describe a time when you had to make a significant technical decision that directly impacted the user experience. How did you balance the technical trade-offs with the needs of the consumer?
- Can you give an example of a project where you used data or customer feedback to influence the product's direction or to prioritize certain features? What was the outcome?

### Do the Right Thing
- Tell me about a situation where you felt a proposed solution or a direction from leadership wasn't in the best interest of the user or the company. How did you handle it?
- Describe a time when you had to prioritize the integrity of the system (e.g., security, data privacy, or code quality) over a deadline or a feature request. What was the situation and what was the result?

### Turn on the Lights
- Can you describe your process for documenting a complex system or feature you've worked on? How do you ensure that your documentation is useful and accessible to different audiences (e.g., new engineers, product managers)?
- Tell me about a time you had to explain a complex technical concept to a non-technical stakeholder. How did you ensure they understood the implications of the decision being made?

### Own It
- Describe a project you were responsible for from conception to launch. What were the biggest challenges you faced, and how did you ensure a successful delivery?
- Tell me about a time a project you were working on failed or didn't meet its goals. What did you learn from that experience, and what did you do to mitigate the impact?

### Better Together
- Describe a situation where you had a technical disagreement with a colleague. How did you approach the discussion, and what was the outcome?
- Can you give an example of how you've actively sought out diverse perspectives when designing a solution? How did that collaboration improve the final product?

### We Play to Win
- Tell me about a time you took a calculated risk to innovate or significantly improve a product or process. What was the potential reward, and what was the outcome?
- Describe a situation where you had to lead a project in a competitive environment. How did you and your team work to deliver a high-quality product under pressure?
